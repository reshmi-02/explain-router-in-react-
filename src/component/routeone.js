            <li>The primary goal of Router in React JS is to supply the browser with an asynchronous URL that corresponds to the data that will show on the web page</li>
            <li>ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single Page Web Applications.</li>
            <li>React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application.</li>
            <li>When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.</li>
        </div>
